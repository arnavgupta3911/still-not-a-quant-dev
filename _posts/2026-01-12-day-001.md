## Where am I in my path to Quant Dev
- Step 1 (Developing basic financial market literacy to better understand the role of Quant Devs)
  
## What I set out to learn today
-  Different types of people in the market, how they react to news and how that influences the price
-  Why the price moves compared to expectations
-  Why markets move when no news

## The idea that finally clicked
-  The idea of market makers and how they influence the market and the price

## What confused me (and still does)
-  Why overcrowded positions influence the market even when there is no news or updates on the stock

## One sentence I want to remember
- Expectations for traders are what they have done in the market, in anticipation of the big news, not what you see on socials.

## What I’m *not* worrying about yet
-  Having a perfect understanding of everything, this is just to dip my toes into the financial market to I better understand my role as a future quant dev.

## What I’ll continue with tomorrow
-  Continuing market literacy and learning about how all these factors influence the market.
