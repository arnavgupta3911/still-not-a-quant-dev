## My Day
Started module 3, did a fair bit but realised that these next modules were not gonna be as easy as the first 2, definetely getting harder and harder. Today was a bunch of loop stuff, like for loops, while loops etc, while I am incredibly familiar with these concepts as I have an extensive coding background, did learn some things about how it is stored in memory and other technical specifics. Did not have the most time today and have got cricket saturday and sunday but will continue monday!
