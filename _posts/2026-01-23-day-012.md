## My Day
Almost done module 4, would of been done but did not realise there was a project at the end to finish module 4 so will tackle that either sunday or monday depending on how I feel sunday. Learnt about different exceptions, sequence types, mutable vs immmutable, variable scope and a bunch of other stuff so pretty good day. Almost done the first course which is pretty cool, they reccomend that it takes 6 weeks and in like 6 days of work I am nearly done which is pretty cool, and that is with small incremental steps, have not worked for more than 3 hours on this a day, but this is what good solid deep work can get, got a game tomorrow, wish me luck!
