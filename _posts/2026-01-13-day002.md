## My Day
So if you look at day 1, you'll see this massively structured and honestly, boring looking page. Well I did not like how unauthentic to me it was so now I am just going to explain what I am doing my way (even if ChatGPT dissaproves 😅). So, today, I did a fair bit of work. I started off with looking at positioning and how heavy positions can impact the market. All the market study I am doing is just to make sure I have a clear picture of my role as a (future) Quant Dev. After that, I got into the hectic part of the day, starting my Python Cert. While I am yet to release my roadmap (gatekeeping bot over here), I do have a plan, and the next step for me, is to get my PCAP-31-03 cert while simulatenously starting a project (but you'll hear about the project tomorrow). So I bought it (cost me a quarter of my net worth btw) and started. Learnt very basic things today like how Python is a scripting language, difference between compiler and interprator etc but I did not do more and the reason for that is because I am a big believer in small bits of work everyday, I hate doing work which feels like a drag, so I worked like 4 hours today, great day. Now I am going to play my sports, relax, and see you tomorrow!
