post   | Day 1 of Still Not Being a Quant Dev

**About Me:** 
You might be wondering, what is this page? Well, let me explain it to you. Hi, my name is Arnav Gupta, and I am on a mission to become a quant developer. A bit of background about me, I am 18 years old, about to enter my second year of university at UNSW, and I love coding, so much so, that I am choosing it as a career path. I have been coding for the last few years and have got two certifications, one in Java (1Z0-811 Oracle Foundations Java) and one in SQL (1Z0-006 Oracle Database Foundations). Additionally I have been working as an intern for a pretty cool startup called Bluubird, you should check it out! But to be honest, I have been looking for a project, a goal, as I feel like backend engineer was too broad to excite me, so I thought, why not be a quant dev. Now if you ask me why I have chosen it, honestly, because it is cool and hard. I will be posting daily blogs, updating my readers on my journey so I hope you guys enjoy it! 

Word of warning, I am sure you have noticed that since the advent of AI, everyone on your Linkedin sounds the same and writes the same, well I hate that, so these blogs will be raw, unedited, thoughts :).
