## My Day
Made up for yesterday, did a fair bit of work today. First I mapped out my project, I'll explain more on a project day as this was still a cert day. Then I got started on my cert course, in preparing for the cert, I am doing 2 courses, both provided by Edube, I have now done 2 modules out of 5 for the first one, obviously things will slow down as it gets harder but currently breezing through it!
