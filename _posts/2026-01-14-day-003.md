## My Day
Being honest here, I did not do much work today towards my goal of being a quant dev. I recieved quited bad news yesterday and honestly it took me a lot of today to recover from that, however I do believe that posting everyday and being honest is essential so that is what I have done. I did do a bit of work today but that was all internship work, not related to my goal to being a quant dev.
