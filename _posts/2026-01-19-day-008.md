## My Day
Continued Module 3, today was the first bit of complexity in the sense of having to learn something new. Had to learn about bitwise operations and twos compliments and how that all relates to python. Definetely very interesting, do not think I have fully wrapped my head around it yet but definetely able to answer the questions asked so far. Took a few hours tho, but glad to do something hard as if it was easy, then everyone would do it and it would not be worth anything.
