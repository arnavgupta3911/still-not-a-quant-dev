## My Day
Did the project, that took about an hour and a half, basic tic tac toe project, wasnt too hard but good test of my python knowledge, made me realise I am a little bit further behind then thought. Did the project 4 test after and got 22/25 which I was very happy about, gonna keep working hard. After that did a bunch of work for this app I am building, but more on that later!
